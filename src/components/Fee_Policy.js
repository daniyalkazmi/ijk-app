              and infectious diseases (such as chicken pox). Staff look after
              children who become unwell during the school day, but we ask all
              parents to provide us with emergency contact numbers so that they
              can be notified if their child is ill and needs to be sent home
              during the school day.

              research for a topic or completing unfinished class work. Homework
              should be regarded as a positive experience and an extension of

              learning environment. A student’s score on bi-monthly tests
              contributes towards his final score. At the end of the year, the
              final grade and percentage of the student is calculated as the
              average of his performance in both terms. The breakdown of the
              cumulative marks for one subject is given below. This regular

              final cumulative score, will not be promoted to the next class and
              will have to repeat the same class. if a student is detained twice
              in same class, his enrolment will be cancelled.
