              How we started?
            </h1>
            <h5>
              The foundation of IJK was laid down back in 2002 when the need of a good educational institute in the area was being felt persistently. Sir Iftikhar, Javed and Kamran took the initiative and started as a small group of tuitions. IJK started making progress by leaps and bounds. The opportunity of the schooling system arose by the immense support and dedication of Riaz Khan’s and Ashar Hassan Khan’s family and we broadened our horizons by opening a school in the year 2012. By the grace of Almighty, today we are home to more than 1500 students and 300 expert faculty and staff that represents us in all walks of life. 9th April 2016 will mark the 4th anniversary of the IJK SCHOOLING SYSTEM.
